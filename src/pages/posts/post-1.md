# My First Blog Post®™

Published on: {pubDate}

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! It's brand new and has never been attempted before by
any mortal.

## What I've accomplished

Absolutely nothing! Aside from:

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I downloaded a computer. Then I put astro on it.

2. **Making Pages**: I was able to press `:w` on `.astro` files and run `npm run dev` like a true
   chad.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: You should be able to witness my genius in this task at the present moment
   in the space time continuum (e.g. now).

## What's next

I don't know, I haven't read that part of the tutorial just yet.
