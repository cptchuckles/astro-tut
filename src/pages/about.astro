		<h2>...and my new astro blog book webface site</h2>

		<p>I am working through Astro's blog tutorial like the uncreative copy-pasta chef that I am</p>
		<p>This site will be updated as I continue through the tutorial, which I have specified here as a caveat per the instructions found on said tutorial pages, since writing my own content is a brainmeats-taxing task that I simply don't have the time for.</p>

		<p>Here are a few things about me:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>I am known as {identity.nick}, or as {identity.handle} on many online accounts</li>
			<li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a(n) {identity.occupation}</li>
		</ul>

		<p>My skills include, but are not limited to:</p>

		<ul>
			{skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
		</ul>
