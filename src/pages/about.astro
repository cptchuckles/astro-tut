<h2>...and my new astro blog book webface site</h2>

<p>I am working through Astro's blog tutorial like the uncreative copy-pasta chef that I am</p>
<p>This site will be updated as I continue through the tutorial, which I have specified here as a caveat per the instructions found on said tutorial pages, since writing my own content is a brainmeats-taxing task that I simply don't have the time for.</p>

<p>Here are a few things about me:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I am known as {identity.nick}, or as {identity.handle} on many online accounts</li>
	<li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a(n) {identity.occupation}</li>
</ul>

<p>My skills include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	{skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
</ul>

{happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro instead of being stuck in some third world prison somewhere for attempted drug smuggling! :DDD</p>}

{finished && <p>I finished the blog tutorial :DDD</p>}

{goal === 3
	? <p>My goal is to finish this in 3 days</p>
	: <p>My goal is to finish this in at least more than 3 days because learning needs to be spaced out far enough for me to forget each step along the way or it doesn't really count.</p>}
