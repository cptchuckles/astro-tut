		<h1>About me</h1>
		<h2>...and my new astro blog book webface site</h2>
		<p>I am working through Astro's blog tutorial like the uncreative copy-pasta chef that I am</p>
		<p>This site will be updated as I continue through the tutorial, which I have specified here as a caveat per the instructions found on said tutorial pages, since writing my own content is a brainmeats-taxing task that I simply don't have the time for.</p>
